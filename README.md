This app allows a user to register an account and access the Geezeo API, provided they have been given the credentials. The app displays a dashboard style overview of the user's accounts, the balance of each account, and a list of recent transactions. A user can click on an account to access a list of transactions for that account.

More details to follow as development progresses...
